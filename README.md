# Jasonapi

This is an experiment in using Elixir behaviours to help define JSON:API spec
compliant serializers. The idea is to defined `Resource`s that implement a
behaviour, and these turn some piece of data into a JSON:API
 [Resource Object](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects).

It is NOT recommended that you use this library at all.
